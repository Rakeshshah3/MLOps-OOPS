1. Class and object(example)
2. Class has attribues/data and function/Methods
  > Code walkthrough
  > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3.Why Python is called OOP?- Everything in python is an object (data structutre,data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPs:
 > You can create your own data type
 > Code reusability
 > debugging
 > easy to colab

5. End to end project (Chatbook class)
   > function vs method
   > magic method or dunder method
   > self
   > You can create attribute class as well

   > Encapsulation
   > Getter and setter
   > Static method 

6. Inheritance
   > Inheritance code example
   > Why Inheritance is needed ?(code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
   > What gets inherited? -Constructor, Non Private methods
   > Constructor overloading and method overloading
   > Super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attribues, used only inside child class)
   > Super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attribues, used only inside child class )
   > Types of Inheritance - 1. Single Inheritance
                            2. Multilevel Inheritance
                            3. Hierarchical Inheritance
                            4. Multiple <Diamond Problem>
                            5. Hybrid
